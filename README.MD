## Current roadmap
Here's the list of what needs to be implemented:
- [x] Model viewing
- [x] Collision viewing
- [ ] Scenery viewing
- [x] Sound playback
- [x] Fully functional editing GUI
- [ ] Ditch any unnecessery dependencies (OpenTK should suffice for sounds and graphics)
- [ ] General code refactoring and rewriting (having 6k lines of code doesn't seem practical)
- [ ] More API optimizations?
- [ ] A lot of other smaller stuff

## Compiling
Just open your project in Visual Studio 2017 and compile it. (requires .NET Framework 4.7)
